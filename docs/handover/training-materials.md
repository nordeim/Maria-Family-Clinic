- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Database client configuration
- `src/server/auth.ts`: Authentication configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Database schema definition
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration

#### Common Development Patterns

**Component Development Pattern**:
```typescript
// components/ExampleComponent.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { api } from "@/lib/api"; // tRPC client

interface ExampleComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export function ExampleComponent({ prop1, prop2 }: ExampleComponentProps) {
  // State management
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  // API calls with React Query
  const { data, isLoading, error } = api.example.getData.useQuery({
    param1: value,
  });
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleAction = async () => {
    try {
      await api.example.action.mutate({
        data: updatedValue,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling
    }
  };
  
  // Render logic
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**API Development Pattern (tRPC)**:
```typescript
// server/api/routers/example.ts
import { createTRPCRouter, publicProcedure, protectedProcedure } from "../trpc";
import { z } from "zod";

export const exampleRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  // Public procedure
  getData: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      param1: z.string(),
    }))
    .query(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Database query logic
      return await ctx.db.example.findMany({
        where: {
          param1: input.param1,
        },
      });
    }),
  
  // Protected procedure
  updateData: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      data: z.object({
        // Input schema
      }),
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Authentication check
      if (!ctx.session?.user?.id) {
        throw new TRPCError({ code: "UNAUTHORIZED" });
      }
      
      // Database mutation
      return await ctx.db.example.update({
        where: { id: input.id },
        data: input.data,
      });
    }),
});
```

### Module 4: Database Operations and Management

#### Prisma Database Operations

**Common Database Queries**:
```typescript
// Find single record
const clinic = await db.clinic.findUnique({
  where: { id: clinicId },
  include: {
    services: {
      include: {
        service: true,
      },
    },
    doctors: {
      include: {
        doctor: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

// Find multiple records with filtering
const clinics = await db.clinic.findMany({
  where: {
    status: "ACTIVE",
    services: {
      some: {
        service: {
          name: {
            contains: searchTerm,
            mode: "insensitive",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    services: {
      include: {
        service: true,
      },
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    name: "asc",
  },
  take: 20,
});

// Complex geospatial query
const nearbyClinics = await db.$queryRaw`
  SELECT c.*, ST_Distance(c.location, ST_Point(${lat}, ${lng})) as distance
  FROM clinics c
  WHERE ST_DWithin(c.location, ST_Point(${lat}, ${lng}), ${radius})
  AND c.status = 'ACTIVE'
  ORDER BY distance
  LIMIT 20;
`;
```

**Database Migration Management**:
```bash
# Create new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_migration_name

# Deploy migrations to production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Reset database (development only)
npm run db:reset

# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# View database in browser
npm run db:studio
```

**Migration Best Practices**:
- Always backup before migrations
- Test migrations in staging environment
- Use descriptive migration names
- Keep migrations small and focused
- Include rollback procedures

### Module 5: API Development and Integration

#### tRPC API Development

**Router Structure Best Practices**:
```typescript
// server/api/root.ts
import { createTRPCRouter } from "./trpc";
import { clinicRouter } from "./routers/clinic";
import { doctorRouter } from "./routers/doctor";
import { contactRouter } from "./routers/contact";

export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  clinic: clinicRouter,
  doctor: doctorRouter,
  contact: contactRouter,
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

**Input Validation with Zod**:
```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Comprehensive input validation
const clinicSearchSchema = z.object({
  latitude: z.number().min(-90).max(90),
  longitude: z.number().min(-180).max(180),
  radius: z.number().min(100).max(50000).default(5000),
  services: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  languages: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  accessibility: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  operatingHours: z.enum(["open_now", "all"]).optional(),
});

export const searchClinics = publicProcedure
  .input(clinicSearchSchema)
  .query(async ({ input }) => {
    // Implementation with validated input
  });
```

#### External API Integration

**Google Maps Integration**:
```typescript
// lib/maps.ts
interface MapsService {
  geocode(address: string): Promise<Coordinates>;
  reverseGeocode(coordinates: Coordinates): Promise<Address>;
  calculateDistance(from: Coordinates, to: Coordinates): Promise<number>;
  getPlaceDetails(placeId: string): Promise<PlaceDetails>;
}

export class GoogleMapsService implements MapsService {
  private apiKey: string;
  
  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
  }
  
  async geocode(address: string): Promise<Coordinates> {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${encodeURIComponent(address)}&key=${this.apiKey}`
    );
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.status !== "OK") {
      throw new Error(`Geocoding failed: ${data.status}`);
    }
    
    const result = data.results[0];
    return {
      latitude: result.geometry.location.lat,
      longitude: result.geometry.location.lng,
    };
  }
}
```

**Email Service Integration**:
```typescript
// lib/email.ts
interface EmailService {
  sendContactConfirmation(enquiry: Enquiry): Promise<void>;
  sendClinicNotification(enquiry: Enquiry): Promise<void>;
  sendStatusUpdate(enquiry: Enquiry): Promise<void>;
}

export class EmailService implements EmailService {
  async sendContactConfirmation(enquiry: Enquiry): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation using your email service
    const emailData = {
      to: enquiry.email,
      subject: "Contact Form Submission Received",
      html: this.generateConfirmationTemplate(enquiry),
    };
    
    await this.sendEmail(emailData);
  }
  
  private generateConfirmationTemplate(enquiry: Enquiry): string {
    return `
      <h2>Thank you for contacting My Family Clinic</h2>
      <p>We have received your enquiry and will respond within 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Your Enquiry:</h3>
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> ${enquiry.subject}</p>
      <p><strong>Message:</strong> ${enquiry.message}</p>
      <p>Best regards,<br>My Family Clinic Team</p>
    `;
  }
}
```
