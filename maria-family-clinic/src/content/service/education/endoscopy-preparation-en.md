**Q: Why do I need to fast?**
A: Fasting prevents food from interfering with the procedure and reduces risk of aspiration during sedation.

**Q: Can I take my regular medications?**
A: Most medications can be continued, but some (like blood thinners) may need to be stopped. Consult your doctor.

**Q: How long will the procedure take?**
A: Upper endoscopy typically takes 15-30 minutes. Colonoscopy takes 30-60 minutes, depending on findings.

**Q: Will I be awake during the procedure?**
A: Most patients receive sedation and are in a "twilight sleep" - not fully conscious but can respond to instructions.

**Q: When can I eat after the procedure?**
A: You can resume normal eating once fully awake and alert, typically within 1-2 hours after the procedure.
