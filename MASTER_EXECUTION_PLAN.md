## Historical Context & Project Evolution

### Initial Challenges
1. **Documentation Location Discovery**
   - Expected Project_Architecture_Document.md at root
   - Found actual location at docs/architecture/
   - Adapted to multiple architecture documentation files

2. **Content Synthesis Complexity**
   - Multiple large documentation files (2,779 + 781 + 826 lines)
   - Healthcare-specific technical requirements
   - AI agent optimization requirements

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Comprehensive Coverage Approach**
